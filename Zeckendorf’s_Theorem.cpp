//Zeckendorfâ€™s theorem states that every positive Every positive integer can be
// written uniquely as a sum of distinct non-neighbouring Fibonacci numbers
//Q) given a number n find all non neighbouring fibonnaci numbers so that they sum n

//this includes a greedy approach
// we simple find ith fib no which is just less that n, and calculate ans for n-fib[i]
// it can be proved by induction that the solution works
